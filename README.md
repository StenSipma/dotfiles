# Introduction
This repository contains some of my main configuration files / dotfiles 

## Overview
Here is an overview of the most notable configurations in this repository (the applications + file locations):
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) - Highly extensible text editor. Config files [.config/nvim/](./config/nvim)
- [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/) - Tiling window manager written (& configurable) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Files in [.xmonad/](./.xmonad)
- [xmobar](https://xmobar.org/) - Status bar used in combination with *XMonad*. Files in [.config/xmobar/](./.config/xmobar)
- [st](https://st.suckless.org/) - Simple Terminal, suckless software, so there is a [separate repository](https://github.com/StenSipma/st) dedicated to my version of st.
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - Application Launch (much more than that, but that is my main use). Files in [.config/rofi](./.config/rofi)
- Shell configuration files are the [.profile](./.profile) (run at login), and the [.bashrc](./.bashrc) (run at bash startup (i.e. terminal start))
- Some other configuration options shared for X applications are found in [.Xresources](./.Xresources)

### Old
This repository still contains some config files which are no longer used such as:
- [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) - Easier (config wise) version of Emacs, with possibilities of Vim keybindings. File [.spacemacs](./.spacemacs)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) - Tiling window manager (swapped for *XMonad*). Files in [.config/i3](./.config/i3)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - Text editor (swapped for *NeoVim*). Files in [.config/vim](./.config/vim)
